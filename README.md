I am a tech enthusiast with an extensive management background, passion for learning, and experience in leading complex projects. 

I recently received a Full-Stack Web Development certificate from the University of Utah and have advanced my skills in CSS, JavaScript, React, Node and Express. Please check out a few of my repos to see how I have applied these skills.
